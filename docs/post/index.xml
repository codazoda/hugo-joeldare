      <description>I wrote these instructions after having written my previous instructions Create a React App from Scratch. The process is almost identical. The result is a much smaller app.
A basic preact application needs npm, yarn, babel, and webpack. This is a step by step guide to installing these things and setting up a minimal initial preact project.
I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you have npm and yarn already installed. Go install those if you don&amp;rsquo;t regularly use them.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you have npm and yarn already installed. Go install those if you don&amp;rsquo;t regularly use them. You can substitute npm commands for the yarn commands below, if you like. yarn add &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; becomes npm install --save &amp;lt;package&amp;gt;. yarn add &amp;lt;package&amp;gt; --dev becomes npm install --save-dev &amp;lt;package&amp;gt;.</description>

      <title>How I Implemented Comments on a Static Site</title>

      <guid>https://www.joeldare.com/blog/post/comments-on-a-static-site/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m using a static site generator for this blog and I was looking for a simple way to add comments without using a 3rd party tool like Disqus. I don&amp;rsquo;t want a 3rd party tracking my users and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to encumber my blog with any server backend. I want the site to be so simple that you could easily host it from your basement on a Raspberry Pi or otherwise very small computer.</description>

      <description>You can use AWK to quickly look at a column of data in a CSV file.
In my case, the CSV files are in the following format:
&amp;quot;field1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;field2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;field3&amp;quot;  To view the 3rd field of every line, you can use the following command.
awk -F &amp;quot;\&amp;quot;*,\&amp;quot;*&amp;quot; &#39;{print $3}&#39; file.csv  As another example, take the following pipe delimited format:
field1|field2|field3  To view the 2nd field of every line, you can use the following command.</description>
