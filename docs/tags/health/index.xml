      <description>Lisinopril has been found to significantly reduce headache during clinical trials.
In 2017 I was prescribed Lisinopril because my blood pressure was slightly elevated. It was just barely outside of normal and could have been elevated just from being at the doctors office. Once I began taking Lisinopril I had a positive side-effect. My daily headaches and occasional migranes went away completely. High blood pressure is said to have no side effects, so reducing your blood pressure should not solve headache problems, but Lisinopril had accidentally helped me.</description>
