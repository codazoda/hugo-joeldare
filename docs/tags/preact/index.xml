      <description>I wrote these instructions after having written my previous instructions Create a React App from Scratch. The process is almost identical. The result is a much smaller app.
A basic preact application needs npm, yarn, babel, and webpack. This is a step by step guide to installing these things and setting up a minimal initial preact project.
I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you have npm and yarn already installed. Go install those if you don&amp;rsquo;t regularly use them.</description>
