I've always liked Steno Pads for writing notes. I'm not sure exactly what it is but the smallish size, spiral bound top edge, and center column are all nice touches.

I work on a lot of business ideas. Most of them have been flops. Lately I've been trying to flesh out the ideas a little better before I waste a lot of time building something. I've adapted a few suggestions from other note taking forms, planner pages, and feedback to a format I currently like for working out ideas on a Steno Pad. Here's the format that's been working for me.

Here are the sections of the idea worksheet.

- Idea Summary
- Problem / Pain
- Solution
- Purpose / Vision
- Customer Profile
- Existing Solutions
- What Now
    
The *What Now* section probably needs some extra explaining. This comes from a comment I read on hacker news that I thought was enlightening.

> Pretend that you just finished your idea and it is now a product on your screen. It's beautiful and has all the awesome features and really works well. What now?

So, in the *What Now* section you should answer that question.
